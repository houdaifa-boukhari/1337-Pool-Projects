## What is the Pool?

The **Pool** is the initial selection phase at 42 School, where students are introduced to programming through a series of intensive projects. It is designed to test problem-solving skills, adaptability, and the ability to learn new concepts quickly. The Pool typically lasts 4 weeks and consists of both individual and group projects.

### Where I Stopped

I stopped my progress in the Pool after completing **C08**.

## Reflections

The Pool was an intense but rewarding experience. Here are some key takeaways from my journey:

- **Adaptability**: Learning to quickly adapt to new programming concepts and tools.
- **Problem-Solving**: Developing a systematic approach to debugging and solving problems.
- **C Programming**: Gaining a solid foundation in C, including memory management, data structures, and file I/O.
- **Shell Scripting**: Improving my skills in shell scripting, including variables, conditionals, and loops.

While I didn’t complete the entire Pool, I’m proud of the progress I made and the skills I developed during this time.
